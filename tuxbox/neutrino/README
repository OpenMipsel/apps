Compiling Neutrino for alexW Images:
------------------------------------

Please check out the HEAD version of apps/tuxbox/neutrino and apply the
patch apps/tuxbox/neutrino/patch.HEAD.for.alexW found in rel_alexW:

patch -p0 < apps/tuxbox/neutrino/patch.HEAD.for.alexW



Suitable other source code:
---------------------------

apps/dvb/tools      : rel_1_0_0
apps/dvb/zapit      : rel_alexW   (cf. README in apps/dvb/zapit)
apps/misc/libs      : HEAD
apps/tuxbox/lcd     : rel_1_0_0
apps/tuxbox/neutrino: HEAD        (patched, see above)
apps/tuxbox/plugins : rel_1_0_0   (call "make .libsigc" before
                                   compiling them, since in the
                                   HEAD cdk, .plugins does not
                                   depend on .libsigc)
apps/tuxbox/tools   : rel_1_0_0
cdk                 : HEAD        (Makefile.am patched, see below)
driver              : rel_alexW



Additional comments:
--------------------
1.) You should use the HEAD branch of cdk (the directory in the cvs tree).

2.) Sectionsd detects the driver version at compile time
  automatically. Hence the old driver headers must be detected. This
  can be done in the following way:

  patch -p0 < apps/tuxbox/neutrino/patch.cdk.Makefile.am.for.alexW


Enjoy
