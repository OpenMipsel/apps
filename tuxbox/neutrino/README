Compiling Neutrino for alexW Images:
------------------------------------

Please check out the HEAD version of apps/tuxbox/neutrino and apply the
patch apps/tuxbox/neutrino/patch.HEAD.for.alexW found in rel_alexW:

patch -p0 < apps/tuxbox/neutrino/patch.HEAD.for.alexW



Suitable other source code:
---------------------------

apps/dvb/zapit      : rel_alexW
apps/misc/libs      : HEAD
apps/tuxbox/lcd     : rel_1_0_0
apps/tuxbox/neutrino: HEAD (patched, see above)
apps/tuxbox/plugins : rel_1_0_0
apps/tuxbox/tools   : rel_1_0_0
cdk                 : HEAD (Makefile.am patched, see below)
driver              : rel_alexW



Additional comments:
--------------------
1.) You should use the HEAD branch of cdk (the directory in the cvs tree).

2.) Sectionsd detects the driver version at compile time
  automatically. Hence the old driver headers must be detected. This
  can be done in the following way:

  patch -p0 < apps/tuxbox/neutrino/patch.cdk.Makefile.am.for.alexW


Enjoy
